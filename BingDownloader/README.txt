Hello this is my first github project so please excuse anything I mess up!

The program is simple, most of this info can be found when clicking the info button on
the program. 

The query box prompts for a search query(what images you want) and the amount is how 
many of those images you want.

SETUP:

This requires python (at least python 3 should work, I know for sure it works on 3.8 because 
that is what I use) so please install that before anything. Once you have python installed
you should find the path of your python.exe, here is an example:

C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python38\\python.exe

Once you have that path, copy and paste it into the python path box and click the set path
button (I only tested this on two computers, crashed on one so if it happens to crash on yours
there is a text doc in the documents folder called python path, just paste your path into the
first line on the doc)

After you have succesfully set your path to python.exe, click the install module button to 
install the bing-image-downloader module by Guru Prasad Singh found here : https://pypi.org/project/bing-image-downloader/

Now you are done with setup, enjoy filling your harddrive with many images!

EXTRA INFO:

All downloaded images can be found in the dataset\bing folder.
